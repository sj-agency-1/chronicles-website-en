    <h1>Strategic Business Consulting from The Business Pathfinder</h1>
    <p>
      In conditions of high market volatility, targeted improvements are insufficient for breakthrough growth. A deep
      rethinking of your business model, operational activities, and strategic focus is required. My services are aimed
      at solving complex challenges where the stake is the sustainability, scalability, and capitalization of your
      business.
    </p>
    <p><b>Principles of Cooperation:</b></p>
    <p>
      All services are rendered upon 100% upfront payment. I reserve the right to unilaterally refuse to provide a
      service if the project does not align with my expertise or resources. In such a situation, the Client will receive
      a full refund of the payment amount, with no penalties or fees applied.
    </p>
